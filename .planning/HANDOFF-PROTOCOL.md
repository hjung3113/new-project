# HANDOFF PROTOCOL

Use this protocol after any reset, handoff, or new agent session.

## Fresh Session Start

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `.planning/STATE.md`.
3. Read `.planning/ROADMAP.md`.
4. Read the active phase `*-CHECKPOINTS.md`.
5. Read `.scratch/phase-state.json` if it exists. If it does not exist, default to `discuss`.
6. Read the active phase `*-CONTEXT.md`.
7. Read the latest relevant `*-SUMMARY.md` and `*-VERIFICATION.md`.
8. Run `git status --short`.
9. Do not edit implementation files unless the live phase state permits it.

## During Work

- Update `.planning/STATE.md` when the current phase, plan, checkpoint, blocker, or next action changes.
- Update the active `*-CHECKPOINTS.md` after each checkpoint.
- Put command results and review outcomes in `*-VERIFICATION.md` or `*-REVIEW.md`.
- Promote durable decisions to `.planning/DECISIONS.md` or an ADR.

## Before Ending A Session

1. Ensure `.planning/STATE.md` has one concrete next action.
2. Ensure live `.scratch/phase-state.json` points to the active plan and checkpoint.
3. Ensure phase summary and verification are current.
4. If a temporary handoff is requested, reference these files instead of duplicating their full contents.

## Subtask Handoff Protocol

### Parent Session Responsibilities

- Classify the request and choose the smallest valid workflow.
- Build a focused handoff packet for the owning mode.
- Create a Roo `new_task` for each non-trivial step.
- Collect the required structured result and synthesize next routing.
- If `new_task` is unavailable, output the handoff packet and stop.

### Subtask Responsibilities

- Reload durable context from `.planning/` and `.scratch/phase-state.json`.
- Stay inside phase gate and owner boundaries.
- Perform only the handed-off scope.
- Return the required structured result without guessing when context is stale.
