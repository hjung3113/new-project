## Agent Skills

Project-local Roo skills live under `.roo/skills/`. Keep project-specific skills in the target repository instead of installing them globally.

## Planning State

Fresh sessions must start with `.planning/STATE.md`, then `.planning/ROADMAP.md`, then `.planning/codebase/**`, then the active phase checkpoint under `.planning/phases/` when one exists. Use `.scratch/phase-state.json` as the live phase gate only after reading durable planning docs.

If `.scratch/phase-state.json` is not `phase=execute` with `approved=true`, do not modify application code. Documentation, harness, and setup changes are allowed only when explicitly requested.

Before creating or reshaping ROADMAP phases, phase folders, ADR decisions, or phase success criteria, run a `grill-me` style alignment pass: ask one question at a time, give the recommended answer and reason, inspect the repo instead of asking when the repo can answer, and record an alignment summary with confirmed facts, inferred facts, user preferences, recommended defaults, open questions, and blocked decisions. Do not turn unconfirmed preferences into phase commitments.

Every roadmap phase starts with its own `discuss` pass before `plan` or `execute`. Before finalizing ADR decisions or phase commitments, run an adversarial review with two relevant expert roles, three lenses each, and the mandatory lens of whether the questions are concrete enough for low-reasoning models. `--auto` may select recommended low-risk defaults and must record auditable `auto_selected` entries. `--chain` may continue through one phase's `discuss -> plan -> execute` only when `.scratch/phase-state.json` is verified or written with `phase=execute`, the same `plan_id`, `approved=true`, `automation_mode=chain`, durable pointers, allowed paths, verification, and review checks.

## File Ownership

- `.roo/**`, `.roomodes`, phase-state schema files, and distributed `scripts/*.py` files are harness-owned.
- `.planning/**` and `.scratch/phase-state.json` are project-owned after initialization.
- `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` may contain managed harness guidance plus project-specific sections.

## Coding Conduct

These defaults incorporate the Karpathy-Inspired Coding Guidelines from `multica-ai/andrej-karpathy-skills`.

### Think Before Coding

Do not assume silently or hide uncertainty.

- State assumptions explicitly before implementing when they affect the solution.
- If a request has multiple reasonable interpretations, surface them instead of choosing silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, mention it and prefer it unless the project context requires otherwise.
- If the requirement is unclear enough that implementation would be risky, stop and ask a focused question.

### Simplicity First

Use the minimum code needed to solve the requested problem.

- Do not add features beyond what was asked.
- Do not introduce abstractions for single-use code.
- Do not add flexibility, configurability, or defensive handling for scenarios that are not required.
- If the implementation becomes much larger than the problem warrants, simplify before finishing.

### Surgical Changes

Touch only what is needed for the requested outcome.

- Do not refactor, reformat, or improve adjacent code unless it is required for the task.
- Match the existing style and project patterns, even when another style would also be valid.
- If unrelated dead code or cleanup opportunities are found, mention them instead of deleting them.
- Remove imports, variables, functions, and files that become unused because of your own changes.

Every changed line should trace back to the user's request or to verification required by that request.

### Goal-Driven Execution

Turn each task into a verifiable goal and keep working until it is checked.

- For bug fixes, reproduce the bug or add a regression test when practical, then make it pass.
- For validation or behavior changes, cover the changed behavior with focused tests when practical.
- For refactors, verify behavior before and after with the existing relevant checks.
- For multi-step work, keep a brief plan with each step tied to a verification command or observable result.

Weak success criteria such as "make it work" are not enough for larger tasks; define the concrete behavior, check, or artifact that proves completion.
