# Workflow: Simple Task

Lightweight path for small tasks where a full phase plan would add more overhead than safety. This workflow is not a loophole around ownership, tests, or specialist workflows.

## Qualifying Tasks

Use this workflow only when all are true:

- The request is narrow and can be completed in one short pass.
- The expected answer or change is easy to inspect.
- The task does not change data contracts, persistence, ETL ordering, security posture, deployment behavior, or architecture.
- The task does not require a durable decision, new issue, migration, broad refactor, or multi-file design.
- Verification is obvious: answer from local context, read the changed text, inspect a targeted diff, run a syntax check, run a focused test, or run a single command.

## Simple Task Types

- `answer-only`: Answer a focused question, explain a nearby file, locate a setting, or give a short recommendation. No file edits.
- `docs-only`: Fix typos, stale references, headings, README notes, comments, or harness documentation.
- `command-only`: Run a harmless command and report the output. Do not run mutating generators, dependency installs, migrations, or deploy commands.
- `mechanical-code`: Make behavior-preserving code cleanup such as removing unused imports, renaming a private helper for clarity, or applying a tiny local formatting fix.
- `tiny-behavior`: Make a very small behavior change only when the expected behavior is explicit, the blast radius is local, and a focused existing or new test can verify it immediately.

Good examples:

- Fix a typo or stale reference.
- Add a short README note.
- Run a harmless repository script and report its output.
- Rename a heading or clarify a sentence.
- Make a small harness documentation sync requested by the user.
- Remove an unused import or dead private helper after verifying it is unused.
- Answer "where is this configured?" with file references.
- Add a tiny guard or display tweak covered by a focused test.

Do not use this workflow for:

- Ambiguous feature work, unknown-cause bug fixes, or behavior changes without immediate focused verification.
- SQL, migration, ETL, ops, authentication, authorization, or data-processing changes.
- Generated files, dependency changes, or broad formatting.
- Tasks that touch many files or require coordination with `.scratch/phase-state.json`.
- Public API changes, data contract changes, cross-module refactors, or durable design choices.

## Steps

1. Classify the task.
   - Name the type: `answer-only`, `docs-only`, `command-only`, `mechanical-code`, or `tiny-behavior`.
   - If it fails any qualifying condition, route to the correct full workflow.
   - If a user explicitly asks for the full phase process, do not use this workflow.

2. Pick the owner.
   - Use the existing mode that owns the file type.
   - For `.roo/**`, `.roomodes`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and harness docs, use `harness-maintainer`.
   - For planning or issue docs, use `architect` or `docs-issues`.
   - Do not bypass mode ownership just because the task is small.

3. Execute minimally.
   - Read only the nearby context needed for the edit.
   - Change only the requested lines and any directly required reference.
   - Do not perform opportunistic cleanup.
   - Do not update `.planning/STATE.md` or phase checkpoints unless the user explicitly asks or the phase/checkpoint/next action actually changes.
   - For `tiny-behavior`, write or identify the focused verification before changing production code.

4. Verify.
   - For `answer-only`, cite the file or command output used when applicable.
   - For edits, inspect the diff.
   - Run the smallest relevant validation command when one exists.
   - For `mechanical-code`, run a syntax, type, lint, or focused test check when available.
   - For `tiny-behavior`, run the focused test or reproduction that proves the change.
   - If no command is meaningful for a docs-only change, state that the diff was reviewed.

5. Report.
   - Summarize the exact files changed.
   - State the verification performed.
   - Mention the simple-task type when it clarifies why the full phase gate was not used.

## Escalation Triggers

Stop and route to a full workflow when the task grows beyond the original scope, requires design judgment, touches specialist domains, lacks focused verification, or creates disagreement between README, `.roo/**`, `.planning/**`, and `.scratch/phase-state.json`.
