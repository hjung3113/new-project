# Workflow: Ops Observability


## Execution Model

When invoked from `orchestrator`, do not execute this workflow inline.

The orchestrator must create a focused subtask in the owning mode and pass the required handoff packet from `.roo/rules-orchestrator/rules.md`.

The owning mode must reload durable context from `.planning/` and `.scratch/phase-state.json`, perform only its owned work, and return the required structured result.

If the task cannot proceed because planning context is missing, stale, placeholder-only, or outside the approved phase gate, return `needs-plan` instead of guessing.

## DB Context Snapshot

When the task depends on SQL Agent jobs, schedules, processing events persisted in MSSQL, retry state, worker polling tables, idempotency tables, restart markers, or stored procedures/functions used by operations flows, read `.db-context/latest.json` before making conclusions.

Use `.db-context/jobs.md` for SQL Agent job steps and schedules. Use `.db-context/routines.index.json` and `.db-context/routines.sql` when operational behavior is implemented through stored procedures, functions, or views.

Do not connect to the database by default. If `.db-context/` exists, use it as the source of truth. Only run `python scripts/db_context_snapshot.py --refresh` when the user explicitly asks to refresh DB context.

If DB context is required but missing, stale, or insufficient, return `needs-db-context` instead of guessing or refreshing automatically.

The expected database model is one master database and many process databases. Process databases are expected to share the same schema shape; check `process_database_comparison` before assuming a process DB schema is representative.

## Steps

1. Check phase gate.
   - Run `workflow-phase-gate` first.
   - Stop before implementation unless phase state is `execute`, `approved=true`, and tied to the approved `plan_id`.
   - Confirm requested edits are inside approved `allowed_paths`.

2. Classify operational behavior.
   - Identify whether the request changes structured logs, metrics, processing events, retry boundaries, worker polling, graceful shutdown, dashboards, or runbooks.
   - Read DB context snapshot files when operational behavior depends on SQL Agent jobs, persisted retry state, processing events, or database routines.
   - Route parser/state/schema/write mechanics back to `/etl` or `/db` when operations is not the primary owner.

3. Define observable contract.
   - Name stable log fields, metric names, event types, retry ownership, cancellation behavior, and failure visibility.
   - Define bounded queue, bounded retry, backlog, throughput, latency, and failure signals where relevant.
   - Cross-check job schedules, job commands, polling tables, and persisted state assumptions against `.db-context/` when available.

4. Red.
   - Write or identify the failing xUnit test first.
   - Record red evidence: command, failing test name, and failure reason.
   - Use `testcontainers-dotnet` with real MSSQL containers when processing events, retries, restart behavior, idempotency, or transaction behavior touches persistence.
   - Stop if no red evidence exists; there is no "tests later" path for operational behavior changes.

5. Green.
   - Implement the smallest change that satisfies the observable contract.
   - Preserve cancellation, bounded concurrency, and graceful shutdown behavior.
   - Do not hide failures with silent catches or unstructured logs.

6. Refactor and verify.
   - Refactor only after green evidence.
   - Run focused operational tests and any impacted integration tests.
   - Report changed paths, red evidence, green evidence, operational signals, and residual risks.

## Hard Rules

- No implementation before phase gate approval.
- No operational behavior change without red evidence.
- No unbounded queues, unbounded retries, silent drops, or swallowed exceptions.
- No persistence behavior proof using mocks, EF InMemory, or SQLite.
- Do not refresh DB context unless the user explicitly asks for a refresh.
- Stop with `needs-db-context` when real DB shape, SQL Agent jobs, or database routines are necessary but `.db-context/` is missing, stale, or insufficient.
